<h2>About</h2>
<p>
I am a penetration tester with    <a href="https://verisgroup.com/">Veris Group</a>â€™s Adaptive Threat
    Division. I work on a wide variety of assessments, but focus primarily on
    network, physical, and red teaming.
</p>
<p>
    In my free time, I try to develop some tools to make me and my teams life a
    little easier, and do some research to catch up to my peers. I will do my
    best to keep this updated with tips and tricks I come across while
    learning, and developing any techniques.
