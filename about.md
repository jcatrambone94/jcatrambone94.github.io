I am a penetration tester formally with [ATD](ps://twitter.com/search?q=%23ATD4Life&src=hash).  I have learned almost everything I know from those guys and wish them all the best in there future endeavors!

I enjoy Network Assessments,  Physical Assessments, and Red Team Engagements.  I tolerate Web App assessments but they can be fun sometimes!

If you have any questions or want to get in touch feel free to follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/n0pe_sled) and send a DM!  If you are interested in any of my other work you can find most of it on my [Github](https://github.com/jcatrambone94).

Cheers!
